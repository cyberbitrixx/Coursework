# ✔️ To-Do List

## Description
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Coursework/blob/b6518e6f7e6d776292125d52526631cfccb5eb14/assets/Untitled%20design-modified.png">

A to-do list application built with SwiftUI that showcases object-oriented programming principles. It enables users to create a personal account, securely log in via Firebase authentication, and efficiently manage their daily tasks using a real-time database integration. The project demonstrates a user-friendly experience through utilization of the OOP paradigm and Swift programming language, which were the main subjects of the Swift course I've studied.

**Note:** This project was initially developed in February 2023 as the final assignment for a [Swift programming language course](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/le-swift?location=2). While it had been resting on my local device, I recently revisited and upgraded it by adding user authentication and authorization capabilities using Firebase (April 2024).
